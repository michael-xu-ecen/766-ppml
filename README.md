## Privacy Preservation Machine Learning with Attacks and Defenses

### Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for implementing Privacy Preservation Machine Learning (PPML) techniques along with various attacks and defense mechanisms. PPML aims to protect sensitive information in machine learning models and datasets from unauthorized access or inference attacks. In its current state, there are two branches off of main. The "attack" branch is authored by Michael Xu and showcases his progress thus far on the attacks.
The "defend" branch is authored by Anna Theodore and showcases her progress thus far on the defenses.

### Problem
This research aims to tackle security concerns related to safeguarding the privacy of personal data. As the field of Bioinformatics continues to expand, it is vital to protect the personal health data of millions of individuals. A challenge arises when attempting to distribute sensitive data. There is a need to conceal enough information to protect the data ownerâ€™s privacy while also sharing enough information to optimize model performance. To protect this private data, this project will implement and test gradient inversion attacks and defenses against these attacks.

### Data
The dataset is breast cancer data compiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas. The dataset will be referred to as BC-TCGA. BC-TCGA consists of 17,814 genes and 590 samples, 61 normal tissue samples and 529 breast cancer
tissue samples.
Currently exploring 3-D Datasets.

### Attack Algorithms
Currently, the algorithms for attack consists of the basic Gradient Inversion attack implemented by GradAttack. 
More information on development in [Attack Branch](https://github.com/michael-xu-ecen/766-ppml/tree/attack)

### Defend Algorithms
Currently, the algorithms for defense consist of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). The basic methodology used is from the Py-FHE Repository referenced above. These algorithms currently only exist in the "defend" branch.

The following file paths that have been changed from the Py-FHE implementation are as follows:
- `py-fhe/tests/bfv/test_he.py` -> New file with Microsoft SEAL attempts<br>
- `py-fhe/tests/bfv/BC-TCGA-Normal.txt` -> New file with dataset example<br>
- `py-fhe/tests/bfv/test_bfv_encrypt_decrypt.py` -> File present in Py-FHE with new parsing algorithms for the specific use case

### Installation
1. Future instructions will be written for installation.
